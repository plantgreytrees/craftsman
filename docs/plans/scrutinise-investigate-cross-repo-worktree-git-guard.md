slug: scrutinise-investigate-cross-repo-worktree-git-guard
goal: The worktree git guard allows only git calls it can prove run in the bound worktree, still lets read-only git through, and a release refusal names a fix that works

# Plan: close the gaps the scrutiny rounds found in the worktree git guard

## Outcome
Under a worktree binding, read-only git runs anywhere; every other git call passes only when the guard proves it runs in the bound worktree, and anything it cannot prove blocks with a message naming `git -C <W>`. The doc-deletion guard refuses `git clean` it cannot prove safe, glob-spelled `git` included. `scope.mjs release` on an unreadable worktree names a fix that works.

## Round 18 findings
Isolated scrutineer on 325443e..b9d8709; root re-ran W1 and W2 on 325443e and b9d8709 extracts. No disputes. Real bash and git confirmed W1 and W2.
- **W1 [Warning][Correctness]** `scripts/pre-guard.mjs:366` (`SETTER`) — the default-assignment arm takes no subscript: `read -r l < f; : ${z[0]=l}; (( z )); git status`, `read -r l < f; : ${z[1]:=l}; (( z[1] )); git status` → 0 on both.
- **W2 [Warning][Security]** `:357` (`CONFIG_INDIRECT`), `:445` (`ownConfig`) — `git -C /tmp/r claen -fdx`, `cd /tmp/r; git claen -fdx` → 0 on both: another repository's config may alias a misspelt subcommand. **Owner decision 2026-11-02: stated limit** (closing it would refuse an ordinary `cd sub && git lfs pull`); not fixed.
- **S1 [Security]** `:1769` (`unquoted`), `:1435-1440` (`SETS_SAFETY_VAR`) — the self-disable scan never decodes `$'…'`/`$"…"` (pre-existing). **S2 [Cross-unit]** `:545` (`views`), `:724` (`bare`), `:1769` build the bash-reading views three ways. **S3 [Test-coverage]** `scripts/pre-guard-docclean.test.mjs:515-539` lacks `git --git-dir /tmp/r claen -fdx`, `export GIT_DIR=/tmp/r; git claen -fdx`, `read GIT_DIR < f; git claen -fdx`, a `select` list, and `${1}`, `$@`, `${@:1:1}`, `$(( $1 ))` after `set -- l` (2 on b9d8709, 0 on 325443e).
- **Owner decision 2026-11-02 (loop end):** ship W1 and the S3 pins, record W2, S1, S2 and positional parameters set other than by `set` as stated limits (Out of scope), then go on to /sync-docs and /craftsman:merge. A later finding in a stated-limit class is out of scope.
- Residual: `help.autocorrect` not run against real git; the views not timed on very large text.

## Earlier rounds
Rounds 1-4 (worktree git guard: guard-allowlist merged d9e257a and reverted aa8f34d, owner decision 2026-10-28; release-wording-2 merged 4147f95) and their findings are in git history. The round-3/4 bypasses still live on main are follow-up F1 below.

## Scope Steps (executable core)

### Step 1 — guard-allowlist (., javascript, high)
REVERTED: merged d9e257a, reverted aa8f34d (owner decision 2026-10-28, round 4); the guard design moved to follow-up F1. Task text: git history.

### Step 2 — release-wording-2 (., javascript, normal)
MERGED 4147f95 (round 3). Task text: git history.

### Step 3 — doc-guard-glob-clean (., javascript, high)
MERGED 2112630. A glob-spelled git command word makes `clean` a removal word again (owner decision 2026-10-28, after `/architect --update` found ARCH-STATE-16/ARCH-DOCS-07 VIOLATED). Task text: git history.

### Step 4 — doc-guard-any-glob (., javascript, high)
MERGED 72a9faf (round 5). A glob in any word makes a command not plain; `help.autocorrect` opens the gate. Task text: git history.

### Step 5 — doc-guard-structural (., javascript, high)
MERGED 1d795e1 (round 6). The gate opens structurally on a globbed git word and on config indirection; `git()` decides. Task text: git history.

### Step 6 — doc-guard-shell-quoting (., javascript, high)
MERGED c41ad91 (round 7). Decision: fail closed (root, 2026-11-01; owner unanswered). `$'...'` decoded; `+=` assignments and bracket-glob command words fail closed. Task text: git history.

### Step 7 — doc-guard-wrapper-config (., javascript, high)
MERGED 96c8740 (round 8). Config indirection is found past wrappers; alias-overridable subcommands left `GIT_BUILTINS`; `$'...'` stops at NUL and `$"` reads as `"`; `env -S` under config indirection fails closed. Task text: git history.

### Step 8 — doc-guard-nul-quote (., javascript, high)
MERGED b6d932a (round 9). The gate reads the cut, uncut and undecoded `$'...'` text; `--attr-source` takes a value; a `HOME`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` name that is not a plain read is config indirection. Task text: git history.

### Step 9 — doc-guard-name-forms (., javascript, high)
MERGED 1824ffd (round 10). One value-option list (`GIT_VALUED_OPTS`, with `--shallow-file`); a `$`-built name where a setter takes a name, and `GIT_CONFIG*` names, are config indirection. Task text: git history.

### Step 10 — doc-guard-name-anywhere (., javascript, high)
MERGED c4a7988 (round 11). A `$` anywhere in a setter's name word, `let`, and an assigning `((…))` open the config-indirection check. Task text: git history.

### Step 11 — doc-guard-arith-context (., javascript, high)
MERGED 1f2339c (round 12). Any arithmetic context holding a `$`, or reading a name beside a `$`-built value, opens the config-indirection check; unparseable text fails closed only when it can reach git (`mayReachGit`); the hint scans are linear. Task text: git history.

### Step 12 — doc-guard-arith-reach (., javascript, high)
MERGED 654fd72 (round 13). `env -S` reaches git in unparseable text; special-parameter substrings, `let` anywhere and values set without a `$` (`+=`, `printf -v`, `read`/`mapfile`/`readarray`/`getopts`, `for`/`select`) open the config-indirection check; the tokenizer refuses `${ cmd; }` / `${| cmd; }`. Task text: git history.

### Step 13 — doc-guard-env-abbrev (., javascript, high)
MERGED 03a1b5c (round 14). One `ENV_SPLIT` reads every abbreviation of `env --split-string`; `declare`/`typeset`/`local -u` counts as a value set without a `$`; text that only arithmetic makes unreadable is re-read with `blankArith` so a built-in git subcommand passes. Task text: git history.

### Step 14 — doc-guard-blank-reach (., javascript, high)
MERGED 2215ff1 (round 15). `blankArith` never blanks a current-shell substitution, which fails closed with `mayReachGit`; `readArith` fails closed when arithmetic reads a name set by `read`/`mapfile`/`readarray`/`getopts` or an expanded `for` list; `configIndirectGit`'s hints also read backslash-newline-joined text. Task text: git history.

### Step 15 — doc-guard-join-flow (., javascript, high)
MERGED 17a58d1 (round 16). `bare` reads the backslash-newline-joined command; `readArith` seeds names set beside a command substitution and lets every word of an assigning command flow into its names; `${#name}` is not a value read. Task text: git history.

### Step 16 — doc-guard-decode-flow (., javascript, high)
MERGED b9d8709 (round 17). The gate and `configIndirectGit` read both ANSI-C decodings of the joined text; `SETS` shares `SETTER` and reads a `for` list, a default assignment and `set`'s positional parameters; `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_COMMON_DIR` and `--git-dir` are config indirection; the self-disable scan reads joined text. Task text: git history.

### Step 17 — doc-guard-array-default (., javascript, high)

Depends on: none (Step 16 merged at b9d8709)
Fixes round-18 W1 and S3. Out of scope: the stated limits below, and F1/F3.
- [ ] 17.1 Failing tests in `scripts/pre-guard-docclean.test.mjs` (same harness): refuse (exit 2, `/doc-write authority/`) both W1 commands; pin every S3 command as refused. → accept: the W1 cases exit 0 on b9d8709; the S3 rows are pinned; every earlier case keeps its verdict.
- [ ] 17.2 `SETTER`'s default-assignment arm takes an optional subscript (`\$\{([A-Za-z_]\w*)(?:\[[^\]]*\])?:?=`). → accept: W1 refused.
- [ ] 17.3 Re-point every moved `cite: scripts/pre-guard.mjs:` range (cite lines only). Run `node --test scripts/*.test.mjs` and `node scripts/arch-check.mjs lint`. → accept: exit 0 and PASS.

## Sequencing
Independent: no shared files or cites. Step 1 is the security fix and goes first when run one at a time; its cite re-pointing (1.5) is last.

## Verification background
- Worktree gate and `gitTargets`: `scripts/pre-guard.mjs:1344-1455`; `namesMutation` `:1323`; `unresolvedConstruct` `:1333`; `usesAlternateGitRoot` `:51`; doc guard `plainWords`/`removalGate` `:346-347`.
- Release refusal: `scripts/scope.mjs:216-224`.
- ARCH-STATE-16 (`state.rules.md:26`): blocks name the fix; parsing that cannot be proven fails closed. ARCH-SAFETY-03: fail closed. ARCH-DOCS-07 (`docs.rules.md:17`): deleting a guarded doc path needs the grant. ARCH-SAFETY-01: interpreters are the sandbox's job.

CONSUMERS:
- The stderr prefix `Git mutation blocked outside the active worktree` is asserted in `scripts/pre-guard.test.mjs` and `scripts/pre-guard-worktree.test.mjs`; kept unchanged.
- The env split-string predicate (`scripts/pre-guard.mjs:444`, `:467`, `:1120`, `:1505`; `WRAPPER_VALUE_LONG` `:1306`) is internal to the guard; only `scripts/pre-guard-docclean.test.mjs` exercises it.
- `scope.mjs release` callers (`commands/_features.md`, `commands/_shared-execution.md`, `agents/unit-runner.md`) see only exit codes and stderr; unchanged.

## Risk & rollback
Step 1 flips the guard's default; the risk is a false block on a legitimate non-allowlisted git call outside W (e.g. `git -C <other> fetch`). That is intended under a binding — the message names `git -C <W>` — and the allowlist covers the read-only calls units use. Rollback: revert the unit's merge commit.

## Out of scope
- Interpreters (`node -e`, `python -c`), renamed git binaries and gitconfig aliases are textually undetectable; ARCH-SAFETY-01 leaves them to the sandbox.
- Stated limits (owner, 2026-11-02, ARCH-SAFETY-15) of the doc guard: an alias in another repository's config reached through `git -C <dir>` or an earlier `cd`/`pushd`; the self-disable scan reading `$'…'`/`$"…"`-decoded names; one shared "as bash reads it" views helper; positional parameters set other than by `set` (a function call). A scrutinise finding in one of these classes is out of scope.

## Follow-ups (PENDING tracker rows, not driven by this run)
- **F1 `followup-guard-redesign`** — the worktree git guard reads command text, and each of four fix rounds opened new holes. Live on main: the round-3 bypasses above (nested/`function` cd, CDPATH, `for`/`read`/`printf -v` GIT_DIR, `-c alias.*`/`core.worktree`, verbs pull/tag/update-ref/branch -f/am, glob-spelled `/usr/bin/g[i]t` incl. doc-guard `git clean`, `script -c`/`flock -c`/`su -c`/`watch`) plus round 4's git-as-runner options and `trap`/`alias` rebinding. Route to `/idea` → `/architect` for a design decision (e.g. judge git after shell expansion, or rely on the sandbox per ARCH-SAFETY-01) before any more code.
- **F2 `followup-release-message`** — `scripts/scope.mjs:224` names `git worktree prune`, which the guard blocks while the binding is still active, and prune is not needed (`refuseDirtyWorktree` returns once the directory is gone). Reword to "remove it, release again, then run `git worktree prune`".
- **F3 `followup-sandbox-verify`** — verify the sandbox blocks writes into a sibling repo from an interpreter (`node -e`, `python -c`) under a binding (ARCH-SAFETY-01). Also note the guard's own `git rev-parse` runs in the hook's environment, not the command's.
