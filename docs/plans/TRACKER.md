# Execution tracker

Shared across sessions. This is the compact human view of execution state.
Only touch rows you created; never prune foreign rows without `/sync-docs --tracker` evidence.

## How to read this

- **Goal** is the user-visible result, not an implementation description.
- **Plan** is a direct link to the plan document. Open it, then use the link's context menu to copy its target into a new session.
- **Status** is one short state only. Review notes, gate results, and merge SHAs belong in **Evidence** or the linked plan.
- **Evidence** is terse: use a commit SHA, test result, review verdict, or a short blocker. Keep the table scannable.
- `PENDING -> IN_PROGRESS -> MERGED -> COMPLETE` is the normal path. Use `BLOCKED` or `PARKED` only with a reason in Evidence.
